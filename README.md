First draft of a small visualisation tool that can filter time-series data, with perticular focus on determining convergence in Monte Carlo simulations.

To run enter the file name, and range for the y-axis:

    [url]?file=[csv file]&startY=[lower bound]&endY=[upper bound]

E.g.:

    index.html?file=data_mean_eccentricity_20151228_201432.csv&startY=0&endY=2.5
